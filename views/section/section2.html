          <h3>Why measure Happyness?</h3>
          <p class="text-left">With an ever evolving workforce and increasing competition, measuring engagement levels alone may no longer be adequate. Since different things matter to different individuals across gender, age groups and seniority levels, measuring overall
            happyness levels and understanding professional choices can give organizations a
            <span>more accurate picture of what really drives their employees.</span>
          </p>
          <p class="text-left">This in turn means
            <span class="text-bold">better decision making, more accurate initiative launches</span> and bringing in a degree of
            <span class="text-bold">accountability</span> and
            <span class="text-bold">measurability</span> to areas that may earlier seem subjective. After all, it is only by figuring out what truly drives their workforce can organizations build strategies that help them stay ahead of the curve.
