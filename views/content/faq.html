                                <p>We believe it’s the HR Team in your organization that should guide us on this one. When employees
                                    are asked a series of work life related questions, they are bound to be curious about
                                    the results. Giving them access to the data makes the process a transparent one. So,
                                    based on your company policies, culture and values, together we can decide how much access
                                    to give and we can customise reports accordingly.</p>

                                    Every question of the tool has been created making sure it is not biased and suggestive. Predominantly, every question has
                                    been made into a situation that the employee is likely to face at work. Since happiness
                                    is a subjective construct, understanding what one would do in different situations is
                                    the most reliable way of understanding an employee’s mind-set.</p>

                                    to the employees over a period of time. There are two ways in which we can ensure employees
                                    participate and answer all the questions.</p>
                                <p>1) Are questions are fun and creative. We are quite sure your employees
                                    will look forward to answering the questions as it won’t feel like the ‘typical’ survey
                                    they have been shown before.</p>
                                <p>2) Unless a question sent earlier isn’t answered, the system doesn’t allow
                                    the employee to answer the other questions of the tool. This also helps ensure every
                                    question is being answered.</p>
